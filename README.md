# Image-Enhancement
IMAGE ENHANCEMENT

The aim of image enhancement is to improve the interpretability or perception of information in images for human viewers or to provide better input for other automated image processing techniques.
Image enhancement is the procedure of improving the quality and information content of original data before processing. The principal objective of image enhancement is to process a given image so that the result is more suitable than the original image for a specific application.
